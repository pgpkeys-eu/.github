### SKS

SKS is both a software package (herein called [sks-keyserver](https://github.com/SKS-keyserver/sks-keyserver) for clarity), and the database synchronisation protocol that it speaks.
The software is effectively end of life; the protocol is not.
There are several other software packages that speak SKS, notably [Hockeypuck](https://github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck), and also [Peaks](https://github.com/r4yan2/peaks) (experimental).

### Synchronising and non-synchronising keyservers

https://keys.openpgp.org does not sync with any other keyserver. It never has, and likely never will.
There are several other keyservers, such as the Mailvelope keyserver, that are (and always have been) similarly standalone.

But the synchronising keyservers still exist, and still sync with each other - this has not changed.
What has changed is threefold:

1. the vast majority have been ported from sks-keyserver to hockeypuck, which has mitigated their stability issues
1. the sks-keyservers.net round-robin domain name has fallen into disuse due to legal uncertainty
1. many distributions (including debian and ubuntu) now use the non-synchronising keys.openpgp.org as their default

If you want to use a synchronising keyserver, you have to pick a specific provider from the list at https://spider.pgpkeys.eu.
Many people (including upstream gnupg) use https://keyserver.ubuntu.com because it has a good reputation for reliability, but it is not the only such choice.

Unfortunately, if you want to be comprehensive you will have to manually iterate through each of the keyserver systems (synchronising and standalone).
But that was strictly true even before keys.openpgp.org - itâ€™s just more noticeable now because so many distros use it by default.

### Background

The [SKS apocalypse](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/sks-devel/2018-05/msg00055.html) rendered the sks-keyserver software effectively unusable.
There are a few old systems still maintained as public-facing services but these are now in a distinct minority.

[Hockeypuck](https://hockeypuck.io) v2.1 and later mitigates the immediate problem by applying size limits to public keys.
This has been (at least initially) at the expense of a slightly broken recon algorithm.
In most cases this breakage has been absorbable, but a small number of operators have experienced runaway failure.
Work to fix this is part of our brief here.
